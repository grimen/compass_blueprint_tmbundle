h1. COMPASS_BLUEPRINT.TMBUNDLE - **beta**

A TextMate-bundle for the awesome CSS/SASS framework *"Compass"*, but with focus on *"Blueprint"* (my favorite CSS framework). With this set of shortcuts/snippets even more productive!

h2. Install this TextMate-bundle...

<pre>mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
git clone git://github.com/grimen/compass_blueprint_tmbundle.git 'Compass + Blueprint.tmbundle'
osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'</pre>

h2. Notice

This is the first release of this bundle, and I suspect that some (or worst case most) of the keyboard shortcuts for _mixins_ might change (keyboard shortcuts don't make much of sense now). TextMate bundles don't support aliased shortcuts, which is a bit of pain in the ass.

P.S. Please let me know if you know a scalable way of making keyboard shortcut aliases in TM without duplicating the snippets - which is the only way I can think of now, but quite a horrible one.
